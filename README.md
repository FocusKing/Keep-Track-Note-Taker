## Installation
Our challenge is to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## Usage
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

## Tests
Great way to test the program is by using node index.js, review the terminal for any errors. You can also console log data to see how the program is running and what information is being pulled through.
